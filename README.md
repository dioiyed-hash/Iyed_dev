5// Why I Created This Project :

I created this project to combine my interest in electrical systems with my passion for programming.  
As a beginner Python developer and an electrician, I wanted to build a practical tool that can be useful in real-life electrical work.

This project helps electricians and students calculate electrical load, current, circuit breaker size, and cable size in a simple and safe way.  
It also helped me practice clean coding, problem solving, and software design using Python.

My goal was to build a real-world application, not just a simple coding exercise. I hope it's help , For me , It's work and simple
